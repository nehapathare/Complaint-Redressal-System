As soon as he/she files the complaint, he/she can use the personal details such as phone number for tracking the complaint.
There is a centralized database in which all the information is stored. The administrator has the rights to login to the admin page and oversee every complaint. He can assign experts to go to the site and resolve the issue.
Further, the admin has the rights to update the database, after the issue has been resolved and with necessary remarks.
This is useful for colleges, marginally large offices, in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military, in many specialized occupations or for that matter any group who is interested to organize it effectively.
